# File Sorter

This Python script automatically organizes files in a specified directory (e.g., your Downloads folder) into categorized subfolders based on their file types. The script supports a wide range of file extensions and can handle duplicates, empty folders, and logs its actions.

## Features

- **Automatic File Sorting**: Moves files into categorized folders based on their extensions.
- **Wide File Type Support**: Includes categories like Images, Documents, Videos, Audio, Archives, Coding files, and more.
- **Duplicate Handling**: Renames files if a file with the same name already exists in the destination folder.
- **Empty Folder Cleanup**: Automatically deletes empty folders after sorting.
- **Logging**: Logs all actions (e.g., file moves, errors) into a `file_sorting.log` file.
